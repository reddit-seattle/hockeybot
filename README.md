# hockeybot

this is a bot for the [/r/Seattle discord](https://discord.gg/reddit-seattle).

has a fun yet relatively simplistic middle-tier to communicate with the NHL API and best-guess typing for those responses.

I am [@burn_piano_island](https://github.com/burn-piano-island)'s baby

similar concept to [Seabot](https://github.com/reddit-seattle/seabot) so please check that readme for implementation details.

One note - the environment variable `botToken` for SeaBot is currently `bot_token` for hockeybot
